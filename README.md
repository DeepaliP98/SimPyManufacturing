SimPyManufacturing
====

``SimPyManufacturing`` contains a Discrete-Event Simulation tool, implemented in Python with help of the Python library SimPy.
The simulation tool reflects a manufacturing site, that represent biomanufacturing factories. The simulation tool can function as an evaluator within simheuristics. 

To set up the environment, use the command ``pip install -r requirements.txt`` in the terminal.


SimPyManufacturing is documented, see: https://simpymanufacturing-documentation.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usage.html. 

To run a simple example use ``example.py``.
